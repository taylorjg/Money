Following are a few of my favourite bits from the book.


* Fake It - Return a constant and gradually replace constants with variables until you have the real code.
* Use Obvious Implementation - Type in the real implementation.

"As soon as I get a red bar, I back up, shift to faking implementations, and refactor to the right code. When ny confidence returns, I go back to Obvious Implementation".
