Following are a few of my favourite bits from the book.

---

* Fake It - Return a constant and gradually replace constants with variables until you have the real code.
* Use Obvious Implementation - Type in the real implementation.

"As soon as I get a red bar, I back up, shift to faking implementations, and refactor to the right code. When ny confidence returns, I go back to Obvious Implementation".

"Triangulation provides a chance to think about the problem from a slightly different direction. What axes of variability are you trying to support in your design? Make some of them vary, and the answer may become clearer."

(page 17)

"Using classes this way in model code is a bit smelly. We would like to use a criterion that makes sense in the domain of finance, not in the domain of Java objects."

(page 34)

"we would be one step closer to eliminating the subclasses if there were fewer references to the subclasses directly. We can introduce a factory method in Money that returns a Dollar."

(page 36)

"This is the kind of tuning you will be doing constantly with TDD. Are the teeny-tiny steps feeling restrictive? Take bigger steps. Are you feeling a little unsure? Take smaller steps. TDD is a steering process - a little this way, a little that way. There is no right step size, now and forever."
